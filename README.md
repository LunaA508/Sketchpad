# Sketchpad
## The Odin Project - JavaScript Basics

I made this project back in 2016, when I was working through the Odin Project.  
The Assignment was to make a cross between a sketchpad and an etch-a-sketch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

	* Includes grayscale fill
* User can also start a new grid and change the number of blocks in the new grid
