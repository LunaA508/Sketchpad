# Sketchpad
## The Odin Project - JavaScript Basics

I made this project back in 2016, when I was working through the Odin Project.  
The Assignment was to make a cross between a sketchpad and an etch-a-sketch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  


* Start with a 16 x 16 grid
* Start with a default fill of white
* User will hover over area to fill
* User can also start a new square grid and set the number of rows/columns
* Include options to change fill:
	* Includes randmom rgb fill
	* Includes grayscale fill
